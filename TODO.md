# Future Productivity Metrics Implementation

## Impact Metrics (Medium Confidence - 75%)
- [ ] Files modified per commit
- [ ] Directory/component coverage analysis
  - Track which parts of the codebase they work on most
  - Identify areas of expertise
- [ ] Type of changes categorization
  - Feature additions
  - Bug fixes
  - Refactoring
  - Documentation
  - Testing
  - Configuration changes

## Code Quality Indicators (Medium Confidence - 70%)
- [ ] Bug fix ratio analysis
  - Track percentage of commits that are bug fixes
  - Identify patterns in bug introduction/fixes
- [ ] Follow-up fixes tracking
  - Monitor commits that modify recently changed code
  - Identify potential quality issues requiring immediate fixes
- [ ] Commit message quality analysis
  - Message length and detail level
  - Conventional commit format adherence
  - Description completeness

## Collaboration Metrics (Medium-High Confidence - 80%)
- [ ] Co-authored commits tracking
  - Count and analyze pair programming sessions
  - Track collaboration patterns
- [ ] Review interactions
  - Track review requests and responses
  - Analyze review feedback patterns
- [ ] Cross-team collaboration analysis
  - Work on shared components
  - Inter-team code contributions

## Additional Features
- [ ] Configurable time zones for commit time analysis
- [ ] Custom metrics definition through configuration
- [ ] Export metrics in different formats (JSON, CSV)
- [ ] Interactive metrics visualization
- [ ] Historical trend analysis
- [ ] Team-level aggregated metrics
- [ ] Customizable report templates

## Technical Improvements
- [ ] Parallel processing optimization for large repositories
- [ ] Better memory management for huge commit histories
- [ ] More granular caching strategies
- [ ] Configurable metric calculation rules
- [ ] Integration with external analysis tools

## Notes
- Current implementation focuses on Code Velocity Metrics as Phase 1
- Future phases should prioritize Impact Metrics and Collaboration Metrics due to their higher confidence levels
- Code Quality Indicators may require more sophisticated analysis algorithms
- All metrics should remain objective and quantifiable
- Consider adding configuration options for metric thresholds and calculations
