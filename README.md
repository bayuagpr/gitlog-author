## Background

Managing and tracking contributions in Git repositories can be challenging, especially in large projects with multiple contributors. Traditional Git logs can be overwhelming and difficult to parse when you need to focus on specific authors' contributions.

## Why Use Git Author Log Generator?

### For Developers
- Preparing for performance reviews by showcasing your contributions
- Building a portfolio of work examples for job interviews
- Tracking your productivity and work patterns
- Creating documentation for your handover when switching teams

### For Team Leads
- Generating sprint review reports of team contributions
- Tracking team member productivity and work distribution
- Creating audit trails for compliance requirements
- Documenting team member impact for promotions

### For Project Managers
- Generating release notes and changelogs by contributor
- Creating handover documentation when team members transition
- Tracking project history and evolution
- Monitoring contribution patterns across teams

### For Organizations
- Maintaining compliance audit trails
- Tracking intellectual property contributions
- Creating documentation for knowledge retention
- Supporting performance evaluation processes

## The Power of Good Commit Messages

Ever wondered why senior developers insist on meaningful commit messages? This tool showcases exactly why - well-structured commit histories become invaluable for career growth, team collaboration, and project maintenance. Your future self (or your team) will thank you for those detailed commit messages when preparing for interviews or tracking down changes months later.

## Features

- Filter commits by author name or email
- Date range filtering with `--since` and `--until`
- Detailed commit information including descriptions and file changes
- Output in clean Markdown format
- Smart author name matching with `--verify` option
- List all repository authors with `--list-authors`
- Skip remote fetching with `--skip-fetch`
- Optional productivity metrics (can be disabled with `--no-metrics`)
- Trend analysis with `--trend=<period>`:
  - Daily trends (last 7 days)
  - Weekly trends (last 4 weeks)
  - Monthly trends (last 6 months)
  - Time distribution (morning/afternoon/evening)
  - Commit type categorization
  - File and directory impact analysis
- Safety features:
  - No diff content included
  - Sanitized filenames
  - UTF-8 encoding
  - Git command validation

## How It Works

This tool operates through several key steps:

1. Repository Validation & Setup
   - Verifies if current directory is a git repository
   - Optionally fetches latest changes (unless `--skip-fetch` used)
   - Creates output directory for logs

2. Author Processing
   - Smart author matching:
     - Exact name/email match
     - Case-insensitive search
     - Partial name/email matching with `--verify`
   - Lists all authors with commit counts via `--list-authors`

3. Data Collection
   - Fetches commits by author within specified date range
   - Processes commit metadata (messages, timestamps, hashes)
   - Collects file change information (without content diffs)
   - Caches commit details for performance

4. Analysis & Metrics (when `--no-metrics` not used)
   - Calculates code velocity metrics
   - Analyzes time-of-day patterns
   - Tracks directory impact
   - Identifies most modified files
   - Categorizes commit types

5. Trend Analysis (with `--trend`)
   - Generates period-based reports (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Calculates rolling trends
   - Aggregates commit patterns
   - Shows time distribution
   - Identifies peak activity periods

6. Output Generation
   - Creates timestamped Markdown files
   - Sanitizes all output content
   - Handles UTF-8 encoding
   - Formats data for readability
   - Includes metadata and summaries

Safety Measures:
- No sensitive diff content included
- File paths sanitized
- Git commands validated
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Memory-efficient batch processing

The tool runs entirely locally using Git commands. No data is sent to external services. However, be cautious when sharing generated logs as they may contain sensitive information from commit messages or file paths.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gitlog-authormd.git

cd gitlog-authormd

# Install script globally
npm install -g .
```

## Usage

```bash
gitlog-author <author> [--since=<date>] [--until=<date>] [--verify] [--no-metrics] [--trend=<period>]
```

### Arguments

- `author`: Author name or email to filter commits by
- `--since`: Show commits more recent than a specific date (optional)
- `--until`: Show commits older than a specific date (optional)
- `--verify`: Verify author existence and show matching authors
- `--list-authors`: Show all authors in the repository
- `--skip-fetch`: Skip fetching latest changes from remote
- `--no-metrics`: Skip productivity metrics calculation
- `--trend=<period>`: Generate contribution trend report (daily, weekly, or monthly)
- `--help`, `-h`: Show help message

### Examples

```bash
# Basic usage with author name
gitlog-author "John Doe"

# Using email address
gitlog-author "john@example.com"

# With date range
gitlog-author "John Doe" --since="1 week ago" --until="today"

# Using ISO dates
gitlog-author "John Doe" --since="2023-01-01" --until="2023-12-31"

# Verify author existence
gitlog-author "John" --verify

# List all authors
gitlog-author --list-authors

# Generate trend reports
gitlog-author "John Doe" --trend=daily    # Show last 7 days trends
gitlog-author "John Doe" --trend=weekly   # Show last 4 weeks trends
gitlog-author "John Doe" --trend=monthly  # Show last 6 months trends
```

### Date Formats

Supports various date formats:
- ISO 8601 (e.g., "2023-01-01")
- Relative dates (e.g., "1 week ago", "yesterday")
- Named dates (e.g., "last monday", "last month")

## Output

The script generates the following Markdown files in the `git-logs` directory:

### 1. Commit Log File (`<author>_commits_<timestamp>.md`)
- Commit messages and descriptions
- Timestamps

## Output Example
You can check the output example in the [output-example/output-example.md](/output-example/output-example.md) file

## Requirements

- Node.js 12.x or higher
- Git installed and accessible from command line
- Must be run from within a git repository 

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Git Not Found**
   - Ensure Git is installed and accessible from command line
   - Add Git to your system PATH
   - Try running `git --version` to verify installation

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Check if you have read access to the Git repository
   - Ensure you have write permissions in the output directory
   - Run with appropriate permissions/sudo if needed

3. **No Commits Found**
   - Verify author name/email is correct
   - Check if repository has any commits
   - Ensure date range (if specified) is valid
   - Try using different name formats (e.g., "John Doe" vs "john@example.com")

4. **Invalid Date Format**
   - Use supported date formats (ISO 8601, relative dates, named dates)
   - Check date string syntax
   - Avoid special characters in date strings

5. **Memory Issues**
   - Try processing smaller date ranges
   - Close other memory-intensive applications
   - Consider increasing Node.js memory limit
