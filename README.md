A powerful CLI tool to generate rich, author-focused Git commit logs with metrics and trends in Markdown format.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**
Before using this tool with AI services, any third party services or sharing logs, please be aware that:
- By default, this tool NEVER shows code diffs for security and performance reasons
- Code diffs are ONLY shown when explicitly requested with `--review` flag
- You're responsible for any sensitive data exposure
- If you work with confidential code, ensure you have permission to share commit logs and diffs

## How It Works

This tool operates through several key steps:

1. Repository Validation & Setup
   - Verifies if current directory is a git repository
   - Optionally fetches latest changes (unless `--skip-fetch` used)
   - Creates output directory for logs

2. Author Processing
   - Smart author matching:
     - Exact name/email match
     - Case-insensitive search
     - Partial name/email matching with `--verify`
   - Lists all authors with commit counts via `--list-authors`

3. Data Collection
   - Fetches commits by author within specified date range
   - Processes commit metadata (messages, timestamps, hashes)
   - Collects file change information (filenames only, no content)
   - Caches commit details for performance

4. Analysis & Metrics (when `--no-metrics` not used)
   - Calculates code velocity metrics
   - Analyzes time-of-day patterns
   - Tracks directory impact
   - Identifies most modified files
   - Categorizes commit types

5. Trend Analysis (with `--trend`)
   - Generates period-based reports (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Calculates rolling trends
   - Aggregates commit patterns
   - Shows time distribution
   - Identifies peak activity periods

6. Code Review (with `--review`)
   - Generate code review report with code diffs
   - Provide checklists for code review
   - Performs risk assessment on changes
   - Memory-efficient streaming for large diffs

7. Output Generation
   - Creates timestamped Markdown files
   - Sanitizes all output content
   - Handles UTF-8 encoding
   - Formats data for readability
   - Includes metadata and summaries

Safety Measures:
- No code diffs included by default
- File paths sanitized
- Git commands validated
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Memory-efficient batch processing

The tool runs entirely locally using Git commands. No data is sent to external services. However, be cautious when sharing generated logs as they may contain sensitive information from commit messages, code diffs, or file paths.

## Installation

```bash
# Option 1: Use directly with npx
npx gitlog-author "John Doe"

# Option 2: Install globally via npm
npm install -g gitlog-author

# Option 3: Clone and install locally

### Date Formats

Supports various date formats:
- ISO 8601 (e.g., "2023-01-01")
- Relative dates (e.g., "1 week ago", "yesterday")
- Named dates (e.g., "last monday", "last month")

### Directory Filtering Format

The `--include-dirs` and `--exclude-dirs` options accept comma-separated lists of directory paths:

- Paths are relative to repository root
- No spaces between commas
- Cannot use both include and exclude at the same time
- Automatically excludes common patterns like:
  - `node_modules/`
  - `dist/`
  - `build/`
  - `.nx/`
  - `coverage/`
  - `.next/`
  - `.cache/`
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `yarn.lock`
  - Minified files (`.min.js`, `.min.css`)
  - Source maps (`.map`)
  - TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`)

Examples:
```bash
# Only include src and tests directories
npx gitlog-author "John Doe" --include-dirs="src,tests"

# Exclude core backend and shared code
npx gitlog-author "John Doe" --exclude-dirs="core/backend,core/shared"

# Include src directory with trend analysis
npx gitlog-author "John Doe" --trend=monthly --include-dirs="src"
```
